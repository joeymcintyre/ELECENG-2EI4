# 2EI4 - Design Project 1: DC Power Supply
This project involves the design, simulation, and implementation of a DC power supply that delivers 3V +- 0.1V at 10mA from a 120V (rms), 1kHz AC source. The design follows the standard building blocks of a power supply:
- Transformer - specification of turns ratio to step down 120V AC.
- Rectifier - choice and justification of rectifier topology.
- Filter - design of filetring stage to reduce voltage ripple.
- Regulator - consideration of regulation for improved stability.

The project includes circuit simulation, physical implementation, and measurement/analysis using the Digilent Analog Discovery (AD2). Results are compared across design calculations, simulation, and experimental measurement to evaluate performance, safety, and design tradeoffs.
