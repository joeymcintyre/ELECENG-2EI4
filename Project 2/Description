ELECENG 2EI5 – Design Project 2: Ideal Voltage-Controlled Switches
This project focuses on designing, simulating, and testing two types of voltage-controlled switches using only MOSFETs, diodes, resistors, and capacitors. The goal is to approximate the behavior of ideal switches while accounting for real-world non-idealities such as voltage limitations, leakage, and switching thresholds.
- Switch Type 1 – Two-terminal switch controlled by a 0V / +5V input, toggling between closed (conducting) and open (non-conducting) states.
- Switch Type 2 – Three-terminal switch that routes an input between two outputs depending on the control signal.

The project requires a test plan to evaluate performance metrics (e.g., maximum operating voltage, non-ideal leakage, switching accuracy), alongside simulation, measurement, and theoretical analysis. Design tradeoffs such as performance, complexity, and cost are also documented.
