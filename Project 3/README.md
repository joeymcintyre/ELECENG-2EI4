# ELECENG 2EI5 – Design Project 3: Single-Transistor Amplifier

This project involves designing, simulateing, and building a single-transistor (BJT or MOSFET) amplifier that accepts ±0.5 V from a 100 Ω source and drives a 100 Ω load with good linearity and <10% attenuation. 
Constraints: use only the Digilent module’s DC supplies, no op-amps, and one transistor. 
Testing uses the function generator through a 100 Ω series resistor, demonstrating multiple waveforms and amplitudes up to 0.5 V. 
Deliverables include a physical circuit, simulations, and a video report covering device/topology choices, component calculations, simulation setup & results (gain and other metrics), a hardware walkthrough, measurement methods, midband gain vs. theory/sim, and linearity at 0.5 V.
